# Coursework-and-Practice
Hello there! 👋 This is where I store all the bits and bobs from my coursework and practice sessions. Think of it as a digital scrapbook of my learning adventures – from coding exercises to project snippets, and maybe a few happy accidents along the way. 🌱👨‍💻 Happy exploring!
